# Full Stack Overview

## Learning Objectives

- Define what full-stack development means
- Identify the key components of front-end and back-end development
- Understand how full-stack skills fit into the software development industry

## Why This Matters

As you begin your journey in the Data Foundations program, understanding the full-stack landscape provides essential context. Modern applications are built in layers, and professionals who understand both the user-facing front-end and the data-driven back-end are highly valued. This week, you will start building skills in version control, Agile methodologies, and Python programming, all of which are foundational to becoming an effective developer in any part of the stack.

## The Concept

### What is Full-Stack Development?

Full-stack development refers to the practice of working across all layers of a software application. A "stack" is the collection of technologies used to build and run an application.

### The Front-End (Client Side)

The front-end is everything users see and interact with directly in their browser or mobile app:

- **HTML** provides structure and content
- **CSS** handles styling and layout
- **JavaScript** enables interactivity and dynamic behavior

Front-end developers focus on user experience, responsiveness, and accessibility.

### The Back-End (Server Side)

The back-end handles the logic, data processing, and storage that power an application:

- **Server** processes requests and runs application logic
- **Database** stores and retrieves data
- **APIs** enable communication between front-end and back-end

Back-end developers work with languages like Python, Java, or Node.js, and manage databases such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.

### The Full Stack

A full-stack developer is comfortable working in both environments. They can:

- Build user interfaces
- Write server-side logic
- Design and query databases
- Deploy and maintain applications

### Common Stacks

| Stack Name | Front-End | Back-End | Database |
|------------|-----------|----------|----------|
| LAMP | HTML/CSS/JS | PHP | MySQL |
| MEAN | Angular | Node.js/Express | MongoDB |
| MERN | React | Node.js/Express | MongoDB |
| Django | HTML/CSS/JS | Python/Django | PostgreSQL |

## Career Context

Organizations seek developers who can bridge teams and understand the entire application lifecycle. Whether you specialize in data engineering, back-end services, or front-end experiences, knowing how all the pieces connect makes you a more effective collaborator and problem solver.

## Summary

- Full-stack development spans front-end (user interface) and back-end (server, database, APIs)
- Understanding both layers helps you communicate across teams and build complete solutions
- This program will equip you with foundational skills applicable across the stack
