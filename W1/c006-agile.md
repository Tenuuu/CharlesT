# Agile

## Learning Objectives

- Define Agile software development
- Understand the core values and principles of the Agile Manifesto
- Recognize the benefits of iterative, incremental development

## Why This Matters

Agile is the dominant approach to software development in modern organizations. Understanding Agile principles prepares you to work effectively in teams that prioritize collaboration, adaptability, and continuous delivery of value. As you progress through this program, you will apply Agile concepts in your projects and sprints.

## The Concept

### What is Agile?

**Agile** is a software development approach based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. Instead of delivering a complete product at the end of a long development cycle, Agile teams deliver working software in short, repeatable cycles called **iterations** or **sprints**.

### The Agile Manifesto

In 2001, a group of software developers published the **Agile Manifesto**, which outlines four core values:

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
>
> - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
> - **Responding to change** over following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

### The Twelve Principles of Agile

The Manifesto is supported by twelve principles:

1. Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
4. Business people and developers must work together daily
5. Build projects around motivated individuals and trust them
6. Face-to-face conversation is the most effective communication
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Maintain a sustainable pace of development
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity: maximize the amount of work not done
11. Self-organizing teams produce the best architectures and designs
12. Regular reflection and adjustment to become more effective

### Key Characteristics of Agile

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Iterative | Work is done in short cycles, delivering increments of functionality |
| Incremental | Each iteration adds new features to the existing product |
| Collaborative | Teams work closely with stakeholders throughout the project |
| Adaptive | Plans and requirements can change based on feedback |
| Customer-Focused | Continuous delivery of value to the customer |

### Agile Frameworks

Agile is a philosophy, not a specific process. Several frameworks implement Agile principles:

- **Scrum:** Uses sprints, roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team), and ceremonies
- **Kanban:** Focuses on visualizing work and limiting work in progress
- **Extreme Programming (XP):** Emphasizes engineering practices like pair programming and TDD
- **Lean:** Reduces waste and optimizes flow

We will explore Scrum ceremonies in more detail in an upcoming topic.

### Benefits of Agile

- **Faster Time to Market:** Deliver working software early and often
- **Higher Quality:** Continuous testing and feedback catch issues early
- **Better Alignment:** Regular stakeholder involvement keeps the product on track
- **Adaptability:** Teams can respond to changing requirements and priorities
- **Team Morale:** Empowered, self-organizing teams are more engaged

## Summary

- Agile is an iterative, collaborative approach to software development
- The Agile Manifesto defines four core values prioritizing people, working software, collaboration, and adaptability
- Agile frameworks like Scrum implement these principles with specific practices
- Agile delivers value incrementally and welcomes change
