# Introduction to SDLC

## Learning Objectives

- Define the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- Identify the common phases of the SDLC
- Understand why a structured development process matters

## Why This Matters

Building software is more than just writing code. Professional development teams follow structured processes to ensure quality, manage complexity, and deliver value on time. Understanding the SDLC provides the foundation for working effectively in any development environment, whether you follow Waterfall, Agile, or another methodology.

## The Concept

### What is the SDLC?

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a framework that defines the stages involved in developing software from initial concept to deployment and maintenance. It provides a structured approach to planning, creating, testing, and delivering software.

### Why Use an SDLC?

- **Consistency:** Establishes repeatable processes across projects
- **Quality:** Builds in checkpoints for review and testing
- **Communication:** Creates shared language and expectations across teams
- **Risk Management:** Identifies issues early before they become costly
- **Documentation:** Produces artifacts that help with maintenance and onboarding

### Common SDLC Phases

1. **Planning**
   - Define project goals, scope, and feasibility
   - Identify stakeholders and resources
   - Create initial timelines and budgets

2. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Gather detailed requirements from stakeholders
   - Document functional and non-functional requirements
   - Create specifications that guide development

3. **Design**
   - Architect the system structure
   - Design databases, interfaces, and components
   - Produce technical documentation and diagrams

4. **Implementation (Development)**
   - Write the actual code
   - Follow coding standards and best practices
   - Integrate components and modules

5. **Testing**
   - Verify that the software meets requirements
   - Identify and fix defects
   - Perform unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing

6. **Deployment**
   - Release the software to users
   - Configure production environments
   - Provide documentation and training

7. **Maintenance**
   - Monitor for issues and bugs
   - Apply updates and patches
   - Enhance features based on user feedback

### SDLC Models

Different SDLC models organize these phases in different ways. We will cover two major approaches in upcoming topics:

- **Waterfall:** A sequential model where each phase completes before the next begins
- **Agile:** An iterative model that delivers working software in short cycles

### Visualizing the SDLC

```
Planning --> Requirements --> Design --> Development --> Testing --> Deployment --> Maintenance

```

## Summary

- The SDLC is a structured framework for building software through defined phases
- Common phases include planning, requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance
- Following an SDLC improves quality, reduces risk, and enables team collaboration
