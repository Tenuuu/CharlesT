# Scrum Ceremonies

## Learning Objectives

- Identify the key ceremonies (events) in the Scrum framework
- Understand the purpose and structure of each ceremony
- Recognize the roles involved in Scrum ceremonies

## Why This Matters

Scrum is the most widely used Agile framework, and its ceremonies provide the rhythm and structure for iterative development. Understanding these events prepares you to participate effectively in sprint-based teams and contribute to continuous improvement.

## The Concept

### What is Scrum?

**Scrum** is an Agile framework for managing and completing complex projects. Work is organized into fixed-length iterations called **sprints**, typically lasting 1-4 weeks. Scrum defines specific roles, artifacts, and ceremonies to guide the process.

### Scrum Roles

- **Product Owner:** Represents stakeholders, manages the product backlog, and prioritizes work
- **Scrum Master:** Facilitates the process, removes impediments, and coaches the team
- **Development Team:** Cross-functional group that builds the product increment

### The Four Scrum Ceremonies

#### 1. Sprint Planning

**Purpose:** Determine what work will be completed in the upcoming sprint.

**Participants:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team

**Activities:**

- Product Owner presents the top-priority backlog items
- Team discusses requirements and asks clarifying questions
- Team selects items they can commit to completing
- Team breaks items into tasks

**Outcome:** A sprint backlog with a clear goal for the sprint.

**Timebox:** Typically 2 hours per week of sprint length (e.g., 4 hours for a 2-week sprint).

---

#### 2. Daily Standup (Daily Scrum)

**Purpose:** Synchronize the team and identify blockers.

**Participants:** Development Team (Scrum Master facilitates, Product Owner may attend)

**Format:** Each team member answers three questions:

1. What did I accomplish yesterday?
2. What will I work on today?
3. Are there any blockers or impediments?

**Outcome:** Team alignment and visibility into progress and obstacles.

**Timebox:** 15 minutes maximum, held at the same time and place each day.

---

#### 3. Sprint Review

**Purpose:** Demonstrate completed work and gather feedback from stakeholders.

**Participants:** Scrum Team and stakeholders

**Activities:**

- Team demonstrates the working increment
- Stakeholders provide feedback
- Product Owner discusses the backlog and what might come next

**Outcome:** Validated increment and updated understanding of priorities.

**Timebox:** Typically 1 hour per week of sprint length.

---

#### 4. Sprint Retrospective

**Purpose:** Reflect on the sprint process and identify improvements.

**Participants:** Scrum Master, Development Team (Product Owner may attend)

**Format:** The team discusses:

1. What went well?
2. What could be improved?
3. What actions will we take to improve?

**Outcome:** Actionable improvements for the next sprint.

**Timebox:** Typically 45 minutes per week of sprint length.

### Sprint Cycle Overview

```
Sprint Planning --> Daily Standups --> Sprint Review --> Sprint Retrospective
       |                                                          |
       |________________ Next Sprint Begins ______________________|
```

### Key Principles

- **Timeboxing:** Each ceremony has a fixed duration to maintain focus
- **Transparency:** All ceremonies promote visibility into work and process
- **Inspection and Adaptation:** Regular opportunities to review and improve
- **Collaboration:** Cross-functional participation ensures alignment

## Summary

- Scrum defines four ceremonies: Sprint Planning, Daily Standup, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective
- Each ceremony has a specific purpose, participants, and timebox
- These events provide the structure for iterative delivery and continuous improvement
- Effective ceremonies depend on active participation and honest communication
