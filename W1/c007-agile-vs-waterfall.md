# Agile vs Waterfall

## Learning Objectives

- Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies
- Identify scenarios where each approach is most appropriate
- Understand the trade-offs involved in choosing a methodology

## Why This Matters

As a developer, you will encounter both Agile and Waterfall approaches throughout your career. Understanding their differences helps you adapt to different project environments and contribute effectively regardless of the methodology in use.

## The Concept

### Overview Comparison

| Aspect | Waterfall | Agile |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Approach | Sequential, linear | Iterative, incremental |
| Planning | Upfront, comprehensive | Continuous, adaptive |
| Requirements | Fixed at the start | Evolving throughout |
| Delivery | Single release at end | Frequent, incremental releases |
| Customer Involvement | Limited to start and end | Continuous throughout |
| Change Handling | Difficult and costly | Expected and welcomed |
| Documentation | Extensive | Just enough |
| Testing | At the end | Continuous |

### Development Flow

**Waterfall Flow:**

```
Requirements --> Design --> Build --> Test --> Deploy
      (Complete each phase before moving to the next)
```

**Agile Flow:**

```
Sprint 1: [Plan -> Build -> Test -> Review] --> Working Increment
Sprint 2: [Plan -> Build -> Test -> Review] --> Working Increment
Sprint 3: [Plan -> Build -> Test -> Review] --> Working Increment
      (Repeat until product is complete)
```

### Requirements Handling

- **Waterfall:** All requirements are gathered and documented before development begins. Changes after this phase are formally managed through change control processes and can be expensive.
- **Agile:** Requirements are captured in a backlog and prioritized. They can be added, removed, or refined throughout the project based on stakeholder feedback.

### Risk Management

- **Waterfall:** Risk is highest at the end because problems may not surface until testing. If the product does not meet needs, significant rework is required.
- **Agile:** Risk is distributed across sprints. Working software is validated frequently, so issues are caught early and course corrections are small.

### Team Structure

- **Waterfall:** Teams are often organized by function (analysts, designers, developers, testers) and hand off work between phases.
- **Agile:** Teams are cross-functional and self-organizing, with all skills needed to deliver a feature within the team.

### Customer Collaboration

- **Waterfall:** Customer involvement is concentrated at requirements gathering and final acceptance.
- **Agile:** Customers or their representatives (Product Owners) are engaged continuously, providing feedback after each sprint.

### When to Choose Waterfall

Waterfall may be appropriate when:

- Requirements are well-understood and unlikely to change
- Regulatory or contractual obligations require extensive documentation
- The project is short with a clear, fixed scope
- The technology is mature and well-known

### When to Choose Agile

Agile is typically better when:

- Requirements are uncertain or expected to evolve
- Rapid delivery and feedback are important
- The project is complex with many unknowns
- Stakeholders want visibility into progress and early access to features

### Hybrid Approaches

Some organizations use **hybrid** models that combine elements of both:

- Plan major milestones upfront (Waterfall-like)
- Execute within milestones using sprints (Agile-like)

This can balance predictability with flexibility.

## Summary

- Waterfall is sequential and plan-driven; Agile is iterative and adaptive
- Waterfall works best with stable requirements; Agile thrives with evolving requirements
- Agile delivers value incrementally; Waterfall delivers at the end
- Choosing the right approach depends on project characteristics and stakeholder needs
